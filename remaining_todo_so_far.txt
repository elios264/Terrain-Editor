Terrain Editor

	Redo algorithm
		- inverted
		- option for split segment just like direction  ( split left, right, both, don't)
		- too many divisons per body, they should be per segment instead.
		- height offset for segments
		- all bodies are now restricted to be same size, modify editor of bodies so they are the same size (remove as an X in the top right)
		- draggable rects
		- each edge must increment slighly the z offset
		
		Conclution:
			/*GroupByAdjacent and */
			split space into equal body sizes, also calculate the number of cuts , 
			then slice as progress according to number of cuts, make caps part of the algorithm as first and last 


	Finish UVMapping Editor ✓
	Make ResourceExplorer a service ✓
	connect Resource Explorer to property editor ✓
	default pink terrain when nothing uvmapping
	fix algorithm (caps, inverted, gap sometimes, y offset for segments)
	settings for default terrain values
	improve resource explorer handle of a lot of files (like when deleting, and the binding for preview should be done in a single worker thread), right click on a heavy folder is awesomely slow
	wireframe mode
	multiple terrains
	3d allow drop resources
	buttons menus
	status bar
	split/join terrains, select vertices, move vertices
	add decorations
	add music, triggers, etc
	improve grids: delete
